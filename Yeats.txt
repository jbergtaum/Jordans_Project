Her Praise

SHE is foremost of those that I would hear praised.	 
I have gone about the house, gone up and down	 
As a man does who has published a new book	 
Or a young girl dressed out in her new gown,	 
And though I have turned the talk by hook or crook
Until her praise should be the uppermost theme,	 
A woman spoke of some new tale she had read,	 
A man confusedly in a half dream	 
As though some other name ran in his head.	 
She is foremost of those that I would hear praised.
I will talk no more of books or the long war	 
But walk by the dry thorn until I have found	 
Some beggar sheltering from the wind, and there	 
Manage the talk until her name come round.	 
If there be rags enough he will know her name
And be well pleased remembering it, for in the old days,
